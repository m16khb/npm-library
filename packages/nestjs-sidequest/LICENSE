GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, excluding any System Libraries, and excluding any portion of the Combined Work that is based on the Library but is not part of the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:

a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or

b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:

a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, if applied to the Combined Work, would make the Combined Work a "Conveying Modified Versions" of the Library, provided you also do each of the following:

a) Make prominent notice in the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

b) Acknowledge the part of the Library that is used in the Combined Work, and how the Library is used in the Combined Work.

c) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.

5. Combined Works with Library Independent of Library.

If you modify a copy of the Library and use it in a Combined Work, but the Combined Work is not a "Conveying Modified Version" of the Library, then you must, if the Combined Work is a "Combined Work with Library Independent of Library", comply with the terms of section 4.

A "Combined Work with Library Independent of Library" means a Combined Work that is not a "Conveying Modified Version" of the Library, and that includes a Library that is independent of the Linked Version.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy or a decision of the Free Software Foundation, the version that the Library specifies as the version number of this License, or any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide or can be elected to the Free Software Foundation's public statement of acceptance of a version, you may choose any version published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library specifies that a proxy can decide or can be elected to the Free Software Foundation's public statement of acceptance of a version, then any later version of the GNU Lesser General Public License will apply to the Combined Work.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new Library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU Lesser General Public License is also available in plain text format.
